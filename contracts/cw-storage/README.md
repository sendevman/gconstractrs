# CW Storage

## Overview

The `cw-storage` smart contract enables the storage of arbitrary `objects` in any [Cosmos blockchains](https://cosmos.network/) using the [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) framework.

This contract allows for storing `objects`, pinning and unpinning `objects` for a given sender address, and it also includes the ability to remove (forget) `objects` if they are no longer pinned.
