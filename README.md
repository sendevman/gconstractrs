## ‚ú® Smart Contracts

This repository contains the Smart Contracts deployed on the [OKP4 network](http://okp4.network) and running on [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com).

The list of currently implemented contracts is as follows:

- [cw-template](./contracts/cw-template/README.md): base smart contract to start coding in the OKP4 blockchain.

## üóÇ Directory Structure

The project is structured around a set of Rust workspaces, each defining a smart contract.

## üèó Build

### Pre-requisites

Be sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) v1.63.0 or higher
- [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) v0.36.3 or higher
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Compiling Smart Contracts to Wasm

To compile the Smart Contracts to Wasm, just invoke the `wasm` goal of the makefile:

```sh
cargo make wasm
```

This will install the rust Wasm toolchain, if not already done, and start the process for compiling the Smart Contracts to Wasm.

### Test Smart Contracts

The Smart Contracts are under unit testing. The tests can be launched with the following invocation:

```sh
cargo make test-coverage
```

## üèì Play with the Smart Contracts

The project comes with a set of convenient tasks to manage the Smart Contracts and the blockchain.
To see the list of available tasks, run the following command:

```sh
cargo make --list-all-steps | grep chain- | sort
```

The list of available tasks is as follows:

```text
chain-add-keys - Add a set of predefined keys (recovered from the seed phrases) to the chain.
chain-clean - Clean the chain data (‚ö†Ô∏è definitively)
chain-deploy-contract - Deploy a specific contract to the chain. The contract must be compiled and the wasm file must be present in the artifacts directory (under target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/...).
chain-deploy-contracts - Deploy all the available contracts to the chain (under target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/...).
chain-init-folder - Initialize deploy folder to make sure scripts have the right permission (needed for linux)
chain-initialize - Initialize the chain with a validator's key and a set of predefined keys. ‚ö†Ô∏è The home directory is cleaned before.
chain-inspect-contract - Inspect a specific contract deployed to the chain.
chain-list-contracts - List all the contracts deployed to the chain.
chain-logs - Show the chain's container logs.
chain-start - Run the full node wasmd application using the chain's home directory under a Docker container.
chain-stop - Stop the chain's container.
```

## Initialize the chain

To initialize the chain, just run:

```sh
cargo make chain-initialize
```

This will initialize the chain's home directory and create a validator's key and a set of predefined keys
(recovered from the seed phrases).

## Start the chain

To start the chain, just run:

```sh
cargo make chain-start
```

This will start the chain's container and run the full node wasmd application.

You can check the chain's logs with:

```sh
cargo make chain-logs
```

## Deploy the Smart Contracts

To deploy the Smart Contracts, just run:

```sh
cargo make chain-deploy-contracts
```

This will deploy all the available contracts to the chain. For this, the contracts must be compiled and the wasm files
must be present in the artifacts directory. See the [Build](#-build) section for more details.

Now, you can interact with the deployed smart contracts and test them out.

## Stop the chain

To stop the chain, just run:

```sh
cargo make chain-stop
```

## Clean the chain

To clean the chain, just run:

```sh
cargo make chain-clean
```

Please be cautious when running this command as it will completely clean the chain's home directory and the action is
irreversible.
