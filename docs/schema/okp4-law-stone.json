The law stone is immutable, this means it can only been questioned, there is no update mechanisms.\n\nThe `okp4-law-stone` responsibility is to guarantee the availability of its rules in order to question them, but not to ensure the rules application.\n\nTo ensure reliability over time, the associated Prolog program is stored and pinned in a `okp4-objectarium` contract. Moreover, all the eventual loaded files must be stored in a `okp4-objectarium` contract as well, allowing the contract to pin them.\n\nTo be able to free the underlying resources (i.e. objects in `okp4-objectarium`) if not used anymore, the contract admin can break the stone.\n\n➡️ Checkout the [examples](https://github.com/okp4/contracts/tree/main/contracts/okp4-law-stone/examples/) for usage information.","title":"okp4-law-stone"}
